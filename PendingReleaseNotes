* In previous versions, if a client sent an op to the wrong OSD, the OSD
  would reply with ENXIO.  The rationale here is that the client or OSD is
  clearly buggy and we want to surface the error as clearly as possible.
  We now only send the ENXIO reply if the osd_enxio_on_misdirected_op option
  is enabled (it's off by default).  This means that a VM using librbd that
  previously would have gotten an EIO and gone read-only will now see a
  blocked/hung IO instead.

* Calculation of recovery priorities has been updated.
  This could lead to unintuitive recovery prioritization
  during cluster upgrade. In case of such recovery, OSDs
  in old version would operate on different priority ranges
  than new ones. Once upgraded, cluster will operate on
  consistent values.
